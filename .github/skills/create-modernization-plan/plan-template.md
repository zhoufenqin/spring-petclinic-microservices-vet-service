# Modernization Plan Template

Use this template to generate modernization plans for applications. Replace placeholders with actual values and customize content based on the specific modernization scenario.

**Planning Philosophy**:
- **Focus on GOALS, not implementation**: Describe WHAT needs to be achieved from the user's perspective
- **Skills define HOW**: All implementation details (frameworks, SDKs, libraries, code patterns, authentication methods) will be determined by the referenced skills
- **No assumptions**: Do not assume or specify any technical implementation approach in the plan - let skills handle all "how" decisions

# Modernization Plan: [Modernization Title]

**Project**: [Application Name]

---

## Technical Framework

**Purpose**: Document the application's current technology stack to provide context for the migration.

**Template**:
```markdown
- **Language**: [Programming language and version, e.g., Java 11, Python 3.9, .NET 6]
- **Framework**: [Application framework and version, e.g., Spring Boot 2.7.18, Django 4.2, ASP.NET Core 6.0]
- **Build Tool**: [Build system, e.g., Maven 3.9, Gradle 8.0, npm]
- **Database**: [Current database, e.g., Oracle 19c, PostgreSQL 14, SQL Server 2019]
- **Key Dependencies**: [Major libraries/frameworks, e.g., Spring Data JPA, Hibernate, Entity Framework]
```

---

## Overview

**Purpose**: Describe the high-level modernization goals without technical details. Focus on business objectives and what will change.

**Template**:
> This migration [describe what is being migrated]. The application currently [describe current state]. The new architecture will:
>
> - [First key change and its business benefit]
> - [Second key change and its business benefit]
> - [Third key change and its business benefit]
>
> The migration follows [describe phased approach without technical specifics].

## Migration Impact Summary

**Purpose**: Create a simple table showing migration impact for each application and its affected services.
**Rule**: Each line should be limited to a maximum of 80 characters.
**Template**:
```
| Application | Original Service | New Azure Service | Authentication | Comments |
|-------------|------------------|-------------------|-------------|----------------|----------|
| [App Name]  | [Old Service]    | [Azure Service]   | [Auth method (Default is Managed Identity if user not specified)] | [User specified request for the migration] |
```

---

## Code

**Purpose**: Break down coding work into discrete migration tasks. Each task represents a user-requested migration from one service/component to another, or a specific business logic modernization.

**Breakdown Rules**:

- Create tasks ONLY based on what the user explicitly requested - do not infer or add implicit tasks
- Group related changes that serve a single user goal into one task (e.g., all changes needed to migrate to PostgreSQL)
- If the JDK version is under 17, add task to upgrade the JDK to latest version unless user specified not to do it
- Find relevant migration skills and create one task for each skill
- **Skill Priority**: Skills are searched in the following order:
  1. Project skills: Skill with location project
  2. Built-in skills: Skill with location custom
- **IMPORTANT**: If there are similar skills defined in project skill `.github/skills/` versus other skills, MUST use the one defined in project.
- Each task should be independently testable with integration tests
- Do not add tests for unimpacted code or existing functionality unless user requested
- **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT read individual skill files at this stage; Do Not include the skill detail in the tasks.

**Java Upgrade Task Guidelines**:
**IMPORTANT**: Only add upgrade task if the JDK version is under 17 or user explicitly requested. Upgrade task must be the first task if exists
When creating upgrade tasks for Java projects (current latest versions: Java 17+, Spring Boot 3.x+, Spring Framework 6.x+), create task highest-level upgrade task that encompasses all necessary changes:

- **Spring Boot 3.x upgrade** (when Java 21+ not explicitly requested):
  - Create a single task: "Upgrade Spring Boot to 3.x"
  - Include in task description: This upgrade includes JDK 17, Spring Framework 6.x, and migration from JavaEE (javax.*) to Jakarta EE (jakarta.*)

- **Spring Framework 6.x upgrade** (when Java 21+ not explicitly requested and Spring Boot not being upgraded):
  - Create a single task: "Upgrade Spring Framework to 6.x"
  - Include in task description: This upgrade includes JDK 17

- **Java 21+ upgrade** (when explicitly requested):
  - Create a single task: "Upgrade Java to version X"
  - Include in task description: Specify the target version and related framework impacts


**Template**:
```markdown
### Task 1: [Task Name]

**Description**: [Brief description of what this task achieves from the user's perspective - focus on business/functional goals only]

**Requirements**:
  The original requirements from user input, leave it to empty if not specified from user input

**Environment Configration**:
  The environment Configration from user input (e.g. endpoint, access id), leave it to empty if not specified from user input

**App Scope**:
  The app folders that this task will operate
  If there are multiple apps to be migrate with the same skill, merge them in one task

**Skills**: 
  - Skill Name: [skill name must be used for the task, e.g., "migration-rabbitmq-to-servicebus"]
    - Skill Location: [Skill location: "project", "remote" and "builtin", "builtin" is renamed from "custom"]
  - Skill Name: [additional skill if needed]
    - Skill Location: [Skill location]

**Success Criteria**: Success Crtiera according to user input, if no input, user the default criteria
- [Pass Build: Yes (default) - Project must compile successfully after migration]
- [Generate New Unit Tests (Mock-based): No (default) - Create mock-based unit tests for newly added Azure integration code to ensure test coverage]
- [Generate New Integration Tests: No (default) - Create integration tests for Azure service interactions when requested:
  - If Azure resources are provided/accessible: Create tests that interact with actual Azure services
  - If no Azure resources are provided: Create integration tests with mocked Azure SDK clients using test containers or in-memory implementations where possible]
- [Pass Unit Tests: Yes (default) - All tests must pass; mock dependent Azure resources if not provided]
- [Pass New Integration Tests: No (default) - Integration tests must pass when generated:
  - With Azure resources: Tests validate actual Azure service connectivity and operations
  - Without Azure resources: Tests validate integration logic using mocked Azure clients, ensuring the integration layer works correctly]
- [Pass Security Compliance: No (default) - No known CVEs exist in project dependencies]


```

---

## Containerization

**Purpose**: Describe how to build the Docker container for deployment.

**IMPORTANT**: Only include Containerization section if the target deployment requires containerization (e.g., AKS, ACA) or if the user explicitly requested containerization. Skip this section for non-containerized deployments (e.g., App Service with code deployment). Only create Dockerfile for the application. Do not include Docker Compose for testing unless user requested.

**Template**:
```markdown
**Purpose**: [One sentence describing containerization goal]

**Dockerfile Location**: [path to Dockerfile, indicate if existing or to be created]
```

---

## Deployment

**Purpose**: Describe the target Azure service for deployment and the tooling to be used.

**IMPORTANT**: Only include deployment section if the user explicitly requested deployment.

**Template**:
```markdown
**Target Azure Service**: [Azure service name, e.g., Azure Container Apps, AKS, App Service]

**Resource Status**: [Specify if using existing resource or will create new service]

**Deployment Tool**: [az cli / bicep / terraform - default: bicep]

**Evaluation**: Run existing integration tests against the deployed endpoint to verify the deployment works correctly.
```

---

## Clarifications

**Purpose**: Document items that were not explicitly requested by the user but may be necessary or beneficial. Ask the user to confirm or provide input.

**Rule**: Only include this section if there are implicit dependencies, nice-to-have features, or ambiguities in the user's request.

**Template**:
```markdown
The following items were not explicitly requested but may be needed for a complete implementation:

1. **[Item Name]**: [Description of what needs clarification]
   - **Why needed**: [Explain the dependency or benefit]
   - **Options**: [List possible approaches or choices]
   - **Recommendation**: [Suggest a default if user doesn't respond]

```
