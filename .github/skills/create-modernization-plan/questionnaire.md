# Clarification Questionnaire

For each question below, first attempt to infer the answer from available context (assessment report, user prompt, project structure). Only present a question via `ask_user` when the answer **cannot** be confidently determined. When asking, list all options and indicate the recommended default. Record every answer — whether inferred or user-provided — for inclusion in the plan's "Open Questions & Questionnaire" section.

## Environment Setup

Should the plan include environment/infrastructure provisioning?

* (Default if no infra configuration found) No — no infrastructure provisioning; focus on code migration only
* (Default if infra configuration found) No — use infrastructure/configuration already defined in the repository (for example, existing IaC, deployment manifests, or pipeline config)
* Yes — provision new infrastructure
* Custom — use an existing externally managed environment specified by the user instead of provisioning or repo-defined configuration (ask for resource group, subscription, environment name, or config path)

## Integration Testing

Should the plan include integration testing to verify migrated services?

- (Default when infrastructure is provided/provisioned) Yes — Real mode: use provisioned infrastructure from `infra/` or user-provided environment
- (Default when no infrastructure is provided) Yes — Mock mode: use mocked dependencies
- Yes — TestContainer mode: use containerized emulators/dependencies for supported services and mock unsupported dependencies
- Yes — Mixed mode: user-specified per dependency (ask for dependency list and mode per dependency)
- No — skip integration testing entirely

### Integration Test Resource Info (only ask when Real mode is selected AND user chose to use existing infrastructure)

If the user selected Real mode testing with an existing environment (i.e., "Custom" environment in the Environment Setup section above), ask for one of the following resource information:

* Azure Resource ID — the full Azure resource ID (e.g., `/subscriptions/{sub-id}/resourceGroups/{rg}/providers/...`) for the target resource(s) the tests will run against
* Subscription ID and Resource Group — the resource group containing the test infrastructure

Record these in `./infra/infra-config.md`.

### Subscription ID for Provisioning (only ask when user chose to provision new test infrastructure)

If the user selected "Yes" in the Environment Setup section (provision new infrastructure), ask:

* Azure Subscription ID — the subscription where test infrastructure should be provisioned

Record this in the infrastructure task's `environmentConfiguration` field. The InfrastructureExpert agent will use it during provisioning and persist the resulting resource info to its private user profile.

## Security & CVE Remediation

Should the plan include a security scan and CVE remediation task? This task runs after all upgrade and transform tasks and before deployment to identify and fix known vulnerabilities.

* (Default) Yes — include security/CVE remediation
* No — skip security/CVE remediation
* Custom - user input the security/CVE requirements

## Deployment Target

Which Azure deployment target should the plan use?

- (Default) Azure Container Apps — includes containerization; no separate containerization task needed
- Azure Kubernetes Service — includes containerization; no separate containerization task needed
- Azure App Service
- Azure App Service Managed Instance
- Azure Function App
- Azure Static Web App
- No deployment — migration only, no cloud deployment
- Custom — user-specified target (ask for details)

## Containerization

Should the plan include containerization (Dockerfile generation)? Skip this question if the deployment target already includes containerization (Azure Container Apps or AKS).

- (Default) Yes — generate Dockerfile and container build configuration
- No — skip containerization
