# Application Assessment

This skill performs application assessment for a single repository using AppCAT tools via the Assessment MCP server.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when you need to:

• Assess a Java or .NET application for cloud readiness and migration issues
• Generate detailed assessment reports with issue analysis and recommendations
• Understand application dependencies, frameworks, and potential migration blockers

## What This Skill Does

This skill performs a simplified assessment workflow:

1. **Check MCP Availability**: Verify that the MCP tools 'appmod-precheck-assessment' and 'appmod-run-assessment' are available
   - If these MCP tools are not configured, return immediately with setup instructions

2. **Run Assessment**: Trigger AppCAT analysis via Assessment MCP server
   - Auto-detects project type (Java or .NET)
   - Installs AppCAT tooling if needed
   - Analyzes code for cloud migration issues
   - Generates structured assessment data
   - Report is stored under `.github/appmod/` directory

3. **Consolidate Report**: Find and copy the latest report
   - Search for `report.json` under `.github/appmod/` subdirectories
   - Common locations: `.github/appmod/appcat/result/report.json` or `.github/appmod/dotnet-appcat/result/report.json`
   - Copy the latest report to `.github/appmod/report.json`
   - This consolidated report should be included in the pull request

## Input Parameters

- `workspace-path` (required): Path to the project to assess

## How to Use

### Prerequisites

Ensure that the MCP tools 'appmod-precheck-assessment' and 'appmod-run-assessment' are available. If not, the skill will return instructions for setup.

### Triggering Assessment

Simply express the intent to assess the application. Example prompts:

• "Assess the application"
• "Run AppCAT assessment for this project"
• "Analyze this application for Azure migration"

The MCP tools automatically:
• Detect project language and framework
• Install necessary assessment tooling
• Execute comprehensive analysis
• Generate report under `.github/appmod/` directory structure

### Report Consolidation

After assessment completes:
1. Search for `report.json` files under `.github/appmod/` subdirectories
2. If multiple reports exist, identify the most recently modified one
3. Copy the latest report to `.github/appmod/report.json`
4. Include this consolidated report in the pull request

## Output Structure

### report.json
Generated by AppCAT via MCP server, typically stored under `.github/appmod/` subdirectories.

Common locations example:
• `.github/appmod/appcat/result/report.json`
• `.github/appmod/dotnet-appcat/result/report.json`
• `.github/appmod/repos/report-{timestamp}.json`

The consolidated report is copied to:
• `.github/appmod/report.json` (include this in pull request)

The report contains:
• **Application profile**: Detected language, frameworks, build tools, and dependencies
• **Issues**: Categorized findings with severity levels (mandatory, potential, optional)
• **Incidents**: Specific code locations and details for each issue
• **Analysis metadata**: Assessment tool version, timestamp, and configuration

## Success Criteria

Assessment is complete when:
• ✅ Assessment MCP server is available (or clear instructions provided if not)
• ✅ AppCAT analysis executes without errors via MCP server
• ✅ Latest report.json located under `.github/appmod/` subdirectories
• ✅ Report consolidated to `.github/appmod/report.json`
• ✅ Consolidated report included in pull request

## Error Handling

**MCP Not Available**:
• Verify that the MCP tools 'appmod-precheck-assessment' and 'appmod-run-assessment' are available
• Return immediately with setup instructions if not available
• Do not attempt to run assessment without MCP

**Assessment Failures**:
• Unsupported project type (only Java and .NET supported)
• AppCAT installation issues
• Invalid project structure or build configuration

**Report Location Issues**:
• No report.json found under `.github/appmod/` subdirectories
• Report file is corrupted or invalid JSON

For any failure, provide clear error messages.
