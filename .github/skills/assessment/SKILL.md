# Application Assessment

This skill performs application assessment for a single repository using AppCAT tools and manages the generated reports, posting assessment summaries to GitHub issues or pull requests.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when you need to:

• Assess a **single** Java or .NET application/repository for cloud readiness and migration issues
• Generate detailed assessment reports with issue analysis and recommendations
• Post assessment results to a specific GitHub issue (typically when invoked by multi-repo orchestration)
• Post assessment results to pull requests for code review
• Understand application dependencies, frameworks, and potential migration blockers

**Note**: For assessing multiple repositories at scale, use the `multi-repo-assess` skill instead, which orchestrates this skill across multiple repositories.

## What This Skill Does

This skill performs assessment for a **single repository**. For multi-repository assessments, see the `multi-repo-assess` skill.

The skill orchestrates a complete assessment workflow:

1. **Run Assessment**: Triggers AppCAT analysis via Assessment MCP server
   - Auto-detects project type (Java or .NET)
   - Installs AppCAT tooling if needed
   - Analyzes code for cloud migration issues
   - Generates structured assessment data
   - Report is stored under `.github/appmod/` directory

2. **Locate Report**: Finds the assessment report
   - Searches for `report.json` under `.github` directory
   - If multiple reports exist, selects the most recently modified one
   - Verifies report exists and is valid

3. **Post to GitHub Issue**: Posts summary to specific issue (primary use case)
   - If `github-issue-url` is provided, posts assessment results to that issue
   - Used when invoked by `multi-repo-assess` skill for distributed assessments
   - Shares findings with team via issue comments

4. **Post to Pull Request**: Updates PR with assessment results (alternative)
   - If no issue URL provided, posts assessment summary as comment to the current pull request
   - Includes issue counts, severity breakdown, and recommendations

## Input Parameters

- `workspace-path` (required): Path to the project to assess
- `github-issue-url` (optional): GitHub issue URL to post assessment results. If provided, results will be posted to this issue instead of a pull request

## How to Use

### Triggering Assessment

Simply express the intent to assess the application. The Assessment MCP server will handle execution. Example prompts:

• "Assess the application"
• "Run AppCAT assessment for this project"
• "Analyze this application for Azure migration"

The MCP tools automatically:
• Detect project language and framework
• Install necessary assessment tooling
• Execute comprehensive analysis
• Generate report under `.github/appmod/` directory structure

### Finding the Report

After assessment completes:
1. Search for `report.json` files under the `.github` directory
2. If multiple reports exist, identify the most recently modified one
3. Verify the report is valid JSON and contains assessment data

### Posting Results

**Default behavior (no issue URL provided):**
• Locate the latest `report.json` under `.github`
• Extract key findings and metrics
• Post assessment summary as comment to the current pull request
• Include issue counts, severity breakdown, and top issues

**When `github-issue-url` is provided:**
• Locate the latest `report.json` under `.github`
• Extract key findings and metrics
• Post assessment summary as comment to the specified GitHub issue
• Include issue counts, severity breakdown, and top issues

## Output Structure

### report.json
Generated by AppCAT via MCP server, typically stored under `.github/appmod/` directory structure.

Common locations include:
• `.github/appmod/appcat/result/report.json` (Java projects)
• `.github/appmod/dotnet-appcat/result/report.json` (.NET projects)
• `.github/appmod/reports/report-{timestamp}/report.json` (timestamped reports)

The report contains:
• **Application profile**: Detected language, frameworks, build tools, and dependencies
• **Issues**: Categorized findings with severity levels (mandatory, potential, optional)
• **Incidents**: Specific code locations and details for each issue
• **Analysis metadata**: Assessment tool version, timestamp, and configuration

## Success Criteria

Assessment is complete when:
• ✅ AppCAT analysis executes without errors via MCP server
• ✅ report.json located successfully under `.github` directory (latest one if multiple exist)
• ✅ Report content is valid and contains assessment data
• ✅ Assessment results posted to current pull request (default) OR to specified GitHub issue (if issue URL provided)

## Error Handling

**Assessment Failures**:
• Unsupported project type (only Java and .NET supported)
• AppCAT installation issues
• Invalid project structure or build configuration

**Report Location Issues**:
• No report.json found under `.github` directory
• Multiple reports found but unable to determine latest (check file timestamps)
• Report file is corrupted or invalid JSON

**GitHub Posting Failures**:
• Invalid issue URL or repository access
• No active pull request context when posting to PR
• Authentication problems
• Network timeouts

For any failure, provide clear error messages. If assessment succeeds but posting fails, consider the assessment still valuable for local review.

## Technical Details

### MCP Server Integration
The Assessment MCP server (configured in `mcp.json`) handles:
• Environment validation and prerequisites check
• AppCAT CLI installation and execution
• Report generation under `.github/appmod/` directory
• GitHub integration for pull request and issue posting

### Report Location Strategy
When finding the assessment report:
1. Search recursively under `.github` directory for `report.json` files
2. If multiple reports exist, select the one with the latest modification timestamp
3. This approach supports various directory structures:
   - `.github/appmod/appcat/result/report.json`
   - `.github/appmod/dotnet-appcat/result/report.json`
   - `.github/appmod/reports/report-{timestamp}/report.json`
   - Any other future directory structures under `.github`

### Posting Strategy
**Pull Request Posting (default)**:
• Automatically posts to the current pull request context
• Requires PR context to be available
• Comment includes assessment summary with key metrics

**Issue Posting (when URL provided)**:
• Posts to the specified GitHub issue URL
• Overrides default PR posting behavior
• Uses GitHub API for comment creation

### Supported Technologies
• **Java**: Maven, Gradle, Spring Framework, Java EE
• **.NET**: MSBuild, .NET Framework, .NET Core, ASP.NET
